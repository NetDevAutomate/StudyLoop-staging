## Session Memory (session-db)

At the **start** of each session, call the `session_search` MCP tool with the
current project path to check for relevant past sessions. Briefly mention any
relevant findings to the user before proceeding with their request.

## Session Export (end of session)

The session database is StudyLoop's core knowledge base and the single source
of truth for what the user is learning and struggling with. It is shared across
machines and powers cross-harness search.

At the **end** of every session — when the user wraps up, says goodbye, or the
work is clearly done — persist this conversation and any struggle signals to the
database by running:

```
session-export --SESSION_EXPORT_FLAG
```

Also explicitly record anything the user struggled with this session so it
surfaces for spaced repetition. If `session-export` is unavailable, note the
failure but do not block the session close.
