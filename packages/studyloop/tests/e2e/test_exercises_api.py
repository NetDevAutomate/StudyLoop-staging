"""Exercise-set API lifecycle — the whole surface against a real server.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
``tests/test_web_exercises.py`` covers these endpoints with a ``TestClient``,
which proves the handlers work in-process. The mandatory coverage gate
(``tests/test_e2e_coverage_gate.py``) asks for more: that each route survives
real ASGI serving, real config loading, real middleware and a real event loop.

Until 0.1.0 that full-stack coverage came from
``tests/e2e/test_journey_exercises.py``, which drove the exercises WEB PANEL.
That panel is not part of 0.1.0 — none of the five testids it used exist in
``web/static`` — so the journey is quarantined and its coverage went with it.
The API itself still ships, so it still needs walking; it just no longer needs
a browser to do it. This module is that walk, and it is the reason the gate
stayed green without a single entry being added to
``ROUTE_NO_FULL_STACK_WAIVERS``.

Ordering matters — the tests share one server and one set, each phase building
on the previous, so they are numbered.
