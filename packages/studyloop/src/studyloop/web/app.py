# CSP for a fully same-origin, no-build static app: every script and vendored
# library loads from this origin (verified in ttyd retirement stage 4 — no
# CDN <script src>, no data: script, and the two former inline <script>
# blocks in index.html were moved to files in the same stage). Three
# documented, load-bearing exceptions on top of that, each found by
# reproduction (loading every page with console-error capture), not
# guessed in advance:
#
# - script-src 'unsafe-eval': Alpine.js evaluates every `x-data`/`x-text`/
#   `x-show`/`@click`/etc. expression string via `new Function(...)`
#   internally (this is Alpine's own documented CSP constraint, not
#   specific to this app). Without it, `script-src 'self'` alone still
#   loads Alpine correctly but every directive throws a CSP `pageerror` the
#   instant it tries to evaluate an expression — the whole app's
#   interactivity goes dark (bindings render empty, `@click` handlers never
#   fire) while the page still "loads". `'self'`-only script SOURCES still
#   hold: no CDN, no inline block, no data: URI.
# - style-src 'unsafe-inline': Alpine's `:style` bindings and `x-transition`
#   set inline `style` ATTRIBUTES at runtime (there is no way to nonce an
#   attribute, only a <style> element or <link>), and xterm.js's own DOM
#   rendering does the same for cursor/viewport positioning.
# - connect-src data: (dev_mode ONLY, see _build_csp below): `--dev
#   --dev-engine ghostty` (opt-in developer renderer,
#   vendor/dev/js/ghostty-web-0.4.0.js) bootstraps its WASM VT100 parser via
#   `fetch("data:application/wasm;base64,...")` rather than
#   `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` against a same-origin URL. Without
#   this, `default-src 'self'` (connect-src's fallback) blocks that fetch
#   and every `--dev` session fails to render with a CSP-caused 404. Scoped
#   to `connect-src` only — script-src stays `'self' 'unsafe-eval'`, no
#   `data:` script source. Scoped to dev_mode only — a learner who never
#   passes `--dev` gets no `data:` relaxation at all, since ghostty-web is
#   the sole consumer (found in the M1 council, A2: the first cut sent this
#   unconditionally, in every mode, for a --dev-only need).
#
# R-13c adds the four directives a CSP audit checks for by name rather than
# trusting default-src to cover them, each verified free of cost here:
# - object-src 'none': no <object>/<embed>/<applet> anywhere in static/.
# - base-uri 'self': no <base> tag anywhere in index.html (verified —
#   zero matches), so nothing currently relies on the default (document
#   URL); pinning it just forecloses a future injected <base> from
#   silently retargeting every relative URL on the page.
# - form-action 'self': every <form> in index.html uses `@submit.prevent`
#   (Alpine intercepts the submit event) with no `action=` attribute at
#   all (verified — zero matches), so no browser-native form POST target
#   exists to restrict; this only forecloses one from appearing later.
# - frame-ancestors 'none': the CSP-native form of the `X-Frame-Options:
#   DENY` already sent below. Kept alongside it, not instead of it — CSP
#   frame-ancestors is unsupported in a few embedded/legacy contexts that
#   still honour X-Frame-Options, and the reverse is true for modern ones
#   that prioritise CSP; sending both is the documented belt-and-braces.

    """Add security headers to every HTTP response — including one built
    from an unhandled exception.

    R-13d: this used to be a Starlette ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` subclass.
    ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``'s ``dispatch()`` only runs its post-``call_next``
    code on the SUCCESS path — when a route raises, Starlette's own
    ``ExceptionMiddleware``/``ServerErrorMiddleware`` builds the 404/500
    response directly against the raw ASGI ``send`` callable, downstream of
    where ``dispatch()`` would have added headers. The result: a 500 (or a
    404 from routing) shipped with NONE of these headers, and the only
    test this middleware had exercised the all-success `GET /` path.

    A pure ASGI middleware wrapping ``send`` fixes this structurally: it
    intercepts every ``http.response.start`` message regardless of which
    layer emitted it, success or error alike. It is also naturally inert
    for the ``websocket`` scope — a WS upgrade has no ``http.response.
    start`` message to intercept (it sends ``websocket.accept``/``.close``
    instead), so these headers correctly never reach the upgrade response.
    That is not a gap: a 101 Switching Protocols response has no document
    to render, so a content policy has nothing to police there.
