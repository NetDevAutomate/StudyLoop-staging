"""Study-plan authoring, storage, and evaluation.

Structured Markdown documents are the source of truth; the sessions DB holds a
derived index plus an append-only checkpoint log.  A plan is evaluated at three
points in every session that runs against it: ``start``, ``mid``, ``end``.

(https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity/teach) —
mission-first, learning records as ADRs, primary sources over recall.
