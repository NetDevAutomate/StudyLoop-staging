# Connect your AI coding tool

StudyLoop turns a supported coding assistant into an AuDHD-aware Socratic mentor. You keep using the tool you already know; StudyLoop supplies the study behaviour, session context, and progress export.

## Supported in the initial pre-release

The core release harnesses are:

- **Kiro CLI** — the reference experience used in StudyLoop demos
- **Codex**
- **Claude Code**

StudyLoop also includes complete integrations for **OpenCode** and **pi**. They are shown as preview harnesses until their live release checks pass on the target environment.

Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and Grok are not part of this pre-release. Their presence on your computer will not make StudyLoop advertise or select them.

## Install automatically

From a StudyLoop source checkout, install every supported harness detected on your computer:

```bash
studyloop install agents
```

Or install one explicitly:

```bash
studyloop install agents --tool kiro
studyloop install agents --tool codex
studyloop install agents --tool claude
studyloop install agents --tool opencode
studyloop install agents --tool pi
```

Then check the result:

```bash
studyloop doctor --category agents
```

The installer links StudyLoop-managed definitions while preserving an existing file as a `.bak` backup when necessary. Use `studyloop install agents --uninstall` to remove links created by StudyLoop.

## Start a study session

The easiest route is the Web UI: open **Study Session**, choose an available harness, and start. From the command line:

```bash
studyloop study "Python generators" --agent kiro
```

Replace `kiro` with `codex`, `claude`, `opencode`, or `pi`.

## What each integration installs

### Kiro CLI

Kiro receives the `study-mentor` agent, its focused skills, and the voice helper. Start it directly with:

```bash
kiro-cli chat --agent study-mentor
```

Kiro is the demo harness because it makes the named mentor and session flow visible without requiring users to understand prompt files.

### Codex

Codex reads the StudyLoop `AGENTS.md` from the project. Launching through `studyloop study` creates the session context and starts Codex in that directory.

### Claude Code

Claude Code receives the `socratic-mentor` agent and a session-export hook. The installer merges the hook into existing settings and does not replace unrelated hooks.

### OpenCode

Two separate mechanisms write two separate sets of files, at two different times:

- **`studyloop install agents --tool opencode`** (the install command above) writes a **global** `study-mentor` agent definition to `~/.config/opencode/agents/study-mentor.md`, available to any OpenCode session on the machine.
- **`studyloop study --agent opencode`** (starting a session) separately writes a **project-local** `.opencode/agents/study-mentor.md` and `.opencode/opencode.json` (StudyLoop's MCP server, in OpenCode's own config schema) into that session's working directory. This happens at session start, not at install time — if you only ran the install command and are looking for these project-local files, that's why they aren't there yet.

Either path gets you the same mentor behaviour. StudyLoop does not choose or hard-code an OpenCode model; your working OpenCode provider and model remain authoritative.

### pi

pi reads the project `AGENTS.md` and resumes through its native `--continue` option. Its session-export mandate writes real pi sessions to StudyLoop’s session database; it does not generate fixture or placeholder progress.

## Data integrity

Agent installation never seeds study progress. Session export records genuine harness sessions, and struggle extraction requires an explicitly configured live model. If the live extractor cannot authenticate or returns invalid data, it fails without writing partial progress.

## Troubleshooting

Run:

```bash
studyloop doctor --category agents --json
```

The human-readable output gives repair guidance; JSON is useful when another agent is helping with setup. If a harness appears unavailable, first confirm its binary responds to `--version`, then rerun the installer for that harness.

For a clean removal:

```bash
studyloop install agents --uninstall
```
