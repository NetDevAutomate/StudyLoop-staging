# StudyLoop

StudyLoop is a local-first study companion for active learning with an AI mentor.
It is designed for learners who benefit from one clear focus, short Socratic
questions, visible progress, and a dependable way to return after a break.

## Start with one useful session

1. Follow the [Setup Guide](setup-guide.md) to install StudyLoop and connect an
   agent such as Kiro.
2. Run `studyloop web` and open the address printed in the terminal.
3. Choose **Study Session**, enter one topic, set your energy, and start.

If you would rather build a routine gradually, [Your First Week](first-week.md)
adds review, plans, and session history one step at a time.

## Choose the support you need

| Mode | Useful when | What StudyLoop provides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Study Session** | You want to understand or practise a concept | A live mentor that asks one useful question at a time |
| **Body Double** | Starting or staying with a task is the hard part | A focused workspace, timer, and quiet agent presence |
| **Today** | Too many possible next steps are competing | One recommended action based on time, energy, reviews, and recent work |
| **Flashcards and quizzes** | Something needs retrieval practice | Local review material and spaced-repetition scheduling |
| **Study Plans** | A larger goal needs shape | A plain-language mission, milestones, and checkpoints |

    Energy-aware pacing, tangible closure, a parking lot for tangents, readable
    themes, and low-shame recovery are part of the workflow rather than optional
    polish. Read the [AuDHD Learning Philosophy](audhd-learning-philosophy.md)
    for the reasoning behind those choices.

## What stays local

Your StudyLoop database, study plans, generated material, and optional note
exports live on your machine by default. The selected AI agent may use its own
provider or local model, so its data handling depends on that agent's setup.
StudyLoop does not make a local workflow automatically offline: the Web UI needs
the local server, and cloud-backed agents still need their provider.

## Current boundaries

- Install from a Git checkout on macOS or Linux; there is no current PyPI or
  Homebrew release.
- Use a laptop or tablet for the Web UI. Phone layouts are not supported.
- Keep `studyloop web` running while using the browser app; there is no offline
  service worker.
- Create study plans through the current Web UI form or CLI. An agent-led
  planning interview is not integrated into the Web UI yet.
- Use the CLI for practice-task generation and verification.

See the [public roadmap](roadmap.md) for what is ready, what is being refined,
and what is deliberately later.
